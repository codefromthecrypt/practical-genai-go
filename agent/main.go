// main shows an agent can perform tasks for you, including figuring out which
// tools to use. Notably, an agent isn't just retrieving information, it is
// performing operations so you don't have to.
//
// This agent was written to be easy to explain in a conference, so it doesn't
// do anything fancy. Real agents are more than just an LLM, a good system
// prompt and a few tools.
//
// For example, https://github.com/block/goose includes a plugin system,
// context summarization, robust LLM handling, and work in progress towards
// Model Context Protocol (MCP), which decouples tool, prompt and resource
// definitions from the agents that use them.
